📊 Exciting Data Analysis Interview SQL Questions and Solutions! 📊

Hello #LinkedIn community! 👋 I recently had the opportunity to tackle some intriguing data challenges during a Flipkart Data Analysis interview SQL Question. I wanted to share my insights and solutions to these questions:

1️⃣ Year-On-Year Growth Percentage Analysis: I analyzed the year-on-year growth percentage of a certain metric by comparing data from consecutive years. This involved calculating the percentage increase or decrease, giving invaluable insights into trends and performance.

2️⃣ Department with Highest Salary Expenditure: By diving into the salary data, I identified the department that incurred the highest salary expenditure. This information is crucial for budgeting and resource allocation.

3️⃣ Employee Groups with the Same Salary: I classified employees with identical salaries into groups. This analysis helps in identifying patterns within the organization and ensures fair compensation practices.

4️⃣ Employee with the 4th Highest Salary: I pinpointed the employee with the fourth-highest salary. This is useful information for recognition and reward programs, as well as for understanding the pay structure.

5️⃣ Departments with More Than One Employee: I identified departments with multiple employees, which aids in managing team sizes and workload distribution.

6️⃣ Departments with No Employees: By identifying departments with zero employees, I highlighted potential gaps or inefficiencies in the organization's structure.

7️⃣ Insightful Departments and Their Employees Overview: I created a comprehensive overview of departments along with their respective employee counts. This visual representation facilitates better decision-making and resource allocation.
